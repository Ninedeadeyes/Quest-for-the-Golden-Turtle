# Quest-for-the-Golden-Turtle

A simple hack and slash dungeon crawler written in the standard python library. 

This is a very Alpha build 

Includes 

Hack and slash action, 
Multiple dungeon levels, 
'Gold' Scoring system,
Sound effects 

Would like to add RPG elements including 

Health system, 
Levelling system, 
Pick up items 


Will also re-do all artwork since they are a bit rubbish at the moment. 


Thanks to Christian Thompson which inspire me with his'Maze Game'to create this.
